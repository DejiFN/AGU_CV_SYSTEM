        The Student CV System purpose is to display student records, projects, achievements, and 
experiences, which can then be accessed by students and the public. This web application stores 
information of the Student User to later display on the platform. Some entities which are named 
Student and Admin would be made a Unique ID because they are different from one and another. 
In order to become part of the system first a user must first register then they can either be a student 
or an admin. A student's courses which they have taken would be displayed, year enrolled, and 
name and surname. Students also have contact information which consists of a phone book, 
LinkedIn and an email address. The admins have the ability to publish a project in which students 
can participate in. They also share the relationship which is the contact information. Where users 
can communicate with one another. 
This application aims to allow students to be able to Add/Update information about themselves 
and the Admins will have the ability to Share running Projects and verify student’s information. 
The public can use the system to view students’ profiles and will manage to contact students 
through their displayed contact information.
